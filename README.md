## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**tieudongta/tieudongta** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I'm an aspiring Business Analyst with a background in tech and a passion for solving problems through data and process improvement. On GitHub, I share analysis projects, workflow automation tools, and collaborate on solutions that bridge business needs with technology.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I transitioned from mass transit and tech into construction, and now I'm merging all that experience into business analysisâ€”like building bridges across industries.
