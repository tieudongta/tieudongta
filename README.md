## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ I'm an aspiring Business Analyst with a background in tech and a passion for solving problems through data and process improvement. On GitHub, I share analysis projects, workflow automation tools, and collaborate on solutions that bridge business needs with technology.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I transitioned from mass transit and tech into construction, and now I'm merging all that experience into business analysisâ€”like building bridges across industries.
